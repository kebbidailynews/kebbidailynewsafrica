  stage. Chisom Nwebunu, the creative mind behind Closet Cater, has built a
  small and medium enterprise (SME) that’s catching the eye of style enthusiasts
  in Nigeria. With a flair for sourcing and selling clothing and accessories for
  a worldwide clientele, Nwebunu is proving that big dreams can thrive from any
  corner of the world, much like the early days of American fashion icons like
  Ralph Lauren, who turned vision into global influence.
