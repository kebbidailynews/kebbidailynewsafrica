  Kebbi State, known as Nigeria’s “Land of Equity,” is grappling with a dire
  healthcare crisis that has sparked outrage among residents and drawn national
  attention. Recent investigations and social media reports have exposed the
  deplorable state of primary healthcare centers (PHCs) across the state,
  raising questions about governance, accountability, and the misuse of public
  funds. This article delves into the most controversial and fact-driven issues
  surrounding Kebbi’s healthcare system, highlighting systemic neglect,
  allegations of corruption, and their impact on vulnerable communities.


  **The State of Primary Healthcare Centers: A Public Health Emergency**


  Primary healthcare centers in Kebbi are meant to serve as lifelines for rural communities, providing essential services like maternal care, vaccinations, and basic treatments. However, recent reports paint a grim picture:




  Dilapidated Infrastructure: Facilities like the PHC in Ujariyo, serving over 1,500 residents, are in total disrepair. Leaking roofs, broken equipment, and unsanitary conditions render them unusable. The PHC in Dabire, Argungu LGA, lacks functional toilets, forcing patients to use open spaces, compromising dignity and hygiene.


  No Doctors, No Drugs: A Sahara Reporters investigation revealed that many PHCs, including those in Birnin Kebbi, lack doctors and essential medications. Women risk their lives giving birth in facilities without skilled attendants or emergency equipment, contributing to Nigeria’s high maternal mortality rate of 512 deaths per 100,000 live births.


  Community Impact: In rural areas like Ujariyo, Asarara, and Gidan Yange, residents must travel long distances to access care, often at great personal cost. The absence of functional PHCs exacerbates preventable diseases like trachoma, which remains prevalent despite interventions.




  These conditions have sparked public outrage, with residents and activists on X platforms accusing the state government of neglecting healthcare despite federal allocations.


  **Allegations of Corruption and Mismanagement**


  Kebbi State’s healthcare crisis is compounded by allegations of corruption and mismanagement, fueling controversy:




  Misuse of Funds: Kebbi generated only ₦9 billion in internal revenue in 2022, relying heavily on federal allocations. Critics argue that these funds are not reaching critical sectors like healthcare. Posts on X have highlighted the state government’s purchase of 2023 model cars for officials while PHCs collapse, raising questions about priorities.


  Lack of Accountability: Despite Governor Nasir Idris’s promises to improve healthcare, there is little evidence of progress. The inauguration of the 10th Kebbi State Assembly in 2023 was touted as a step toward better governance, but activists argue that oversight mechanisms remain weak.


  Federal Neglect: Kebbi’s dependence on federal funds mirrors a broader national issue. Nigeria’s 2023 demonetization policy and fuel subsidy removal, implemented under President Bola Tinubu, have strained state economies, limiting resources for social services. However, critics argue that Kebbi’s leadership has failed to prioritize healthcare within these constraints.




  **Controversial Incidents Amplifying the Crisis**


  Several high-profile incidents have intensified public anger and drawn attention to Kebbi’s healthcare and social challenges:




  Infant Burial Case: In June 2025, a farmer in Kamba, Dandi LGA, rescued a newborn girl buried alive on his farmland. This shocking act, linked to cultural practices or desperation, underscores the lack of social services and healthcare support for vulnerable mothers.


  Police Violence: In June 2024, a drunk police officer in Yauri LGA shot and killed 20-year-old orphan Ahmed Ibrahim, highlighting issues of law enforcement misconduct and lack of oversight. Such incidents divert attention from healthcare reforms and erode public trust.


  Trachoma Prevalence: Despite interventions, Kebbi remains a hotspot for trachoma, a preventable eye disease. Surveys from 2014–2016 showed progress, but the lack of sustained investment in water, sanitation, and healthcare infrastructure has hindered elimination efforts.




  **Government Response and Public Sentiment**


  Governor Nasir Idris, who assumed office in May 2023, has emphasized agricultural development, particularly rice production, to reduce Kebbi’s reliance on federal funds. His administration signed trade protocols with Benin Republic to boost economic ties, but critics argue that these efforts sideline healthcare.




  Public Outrage on X: Posts on X reflect growing frustration. @monitng exposed the state of PHCs in Ujariyo and Dabire, calling for urgent action from @KBStGovt. @iam_bussie criticized Kebbi’s low revenue generation and poor living standards, ranking it among Nigeria’s least prosperous states.


  Security Concerns: Kebbi’s volatile security situation, including banditry and terrorism, further strains resources. In July 2025, Nigerian soldiers killed over 150 bandits in a Kebbi ambush, but such incidents divert funds from social services.




  **Impact on Vulnerable Populations**


  The healthcare crisis disproportionately affects women, children, and rural communities:




  Maternal and Child Health: Without skilled attendants or drugs, maternal and infant mortality rates remain high. The lack of antenatal care and emergency services exacerbates risks.


  Cultural Practices: Practices like child marriage (76% prevalence in Northwest Nigeria) and infanticide, as seen in the Kamba case, reflect systemic failures in education and healthcare access.


  Ethnic Marginalization: Kebbi’s diverse ethnic groups, including Hausa, Fulani, and Dakarki, face varying degrees of marginalization, with rural communities receiving less attention than urban centers like Birnin Kebbi.






  **To address this crisis, Kebbi’s government must:**




  Prioritize Healthcare Funding: Allocate a larger share of federal and state funds to repair PHCs, hire doctors, and stock medications.


  Enhance Accountability: Establish transparent oversight mechanisms to track healthcare spending and prevent mismanagement.


  Invest in Social Services: Address cultural practices through education and support for vulnerable mothers and children.


  Collaborate with NGOs: Partner with organizations like WHO and Amnesty International to improve trachoma elimination and maternal health programs.


  Engage Communities: Work with local leaders and diaspora groups to rebuild trust and prioritize rural healthcare.




  **Conclusion**


  Kebbi State’s healthcare crisis is a stark reminder of Nigeria’s broader challenges with governance, resource allocation, and systemic neglect. The collapse of PHCs, coupled with allegations of corruption and high-profile incidents like the Kamba infanticide, has fueled public outrage and demands for change. While Governor Idris’s administration focuses on agriculture and trade, the neglect of healthcare undermines Kebbi’s potential as a hub of equity and progress. Immediate action is needed to restore trust, save lives, and fulfill the state’s promise to its people.
