  In the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, now entering its fourth year as of
  August 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently
  emphasized a distinction between hastily brokered agreements and genuine,
  enduring peace. His stance, often summarized as not being in a rush for a mere
  peace agreement but for true peace, reflects a cautious approach shaped by
  historical betrayals, territorial losses, and the need for robust security
  guarantees. This position comes amid intensified diplomatic efforts, including
  high-stakes meetings in Washington involving U.S. President Donald Trump,
  European leaders, and Zelensky himself. As the war grinds on, with escalating
  drone warfare and shifting international dynamics, Zelensky's insistence on a
  "lasting" peace underscores Ukraine's determination to avoid concessions that
  could embolden further Russian aggression. This article explores Zelensky's
  perspective in depth, touching on the roles of Europe, the USA, the UK,
  Russia, the pivotal use of drones, and broader elements such as military aid,
  economic impacts, and global security implications.


  **Zelensky's Stance: Prioritizing Sustainable Peace Over Quick Fixes**


  Zelensky's rhetoric has evolved since the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, but a core theme persists: Ukraine will not sacrifice its sovereignty or territorial integrity for a fragile truce. In recent statements, he has rejected any deal that involves ceding unoccupied land to Russia, arguing that past concessions—like the 2014 annexation of Crimea and partial control of Donbas—only served as "springboards" for further attacks. He has pointed to the failure of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, where Ukraine denuclearized in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the U.S., and the UK, which proved worthless when Russia invaded.


  Ahead of his August 18, 2025, meeting with Trump, Zelensky reiterated that peace must be "lasting" and include credible security guarantees, the return of abducted children, and a halt to hostilities before negotiations can proceed. He has described discussions without a ceasefire as impossible, proposing the current contact line as a starting point for talks. This position is not mere intransigence; it stems from Ukraine's experience that rushed agreements, like the Minsk accords, failed to prevent escalation. Zelensky has also tied peace to constitutional constraints, noting that Ukraine's charter prohibits surrendering territory, which he refuses to amend lightly despite criticisms that it prolongs the conflict.


  Public sentiment in Ukraine largely aligns with this view. While war weariness is evident, polls and social media discussions show strong opposition to territorial concessions, with many viewing Zelensky as a defender rather than an obstacle to peace. Critics, including some opposition figures, argue that Zelensky's mandate expired in 2024 due to delayed elections amid martial law, urging Trump to prioritize restoring electoral processes as part of any deal. Nonetheless, Zelensky maintains that without legitimacy and security, any agreement would be "dead" and ineffective.


  **The United States: Trump's Push for a Deal and Shifting Dynamics**


  The U.S. has been a cornerstone of Ukraine's support, providing billions in aid since 2022, but under President Trump in 2025, the focus has shifted toward a rapid resolution. Following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, Trump urged Zelensky to accept a peace framework that includes ceding parts of Donbas and potentially Crimea, dropping demands for a prior ceasefire. Trump has framed this as a way to end the war "almost immediately," threatening economic sanctions on Russia if uncooperative, while offering NATO-style security guarantees to Ukraine.


  This approach contrasts with the Biden administration's legacy, which emphasized sustained military support but faced criticism for insufficient aid that prolonged the conflict. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Zelensky on August 18, 2025, is seen as pivotal, with some fearing it could pressure Ukraine into unfavorable terms. However, Zelensky has pushed back, insisting on U.S.-backed guarantees to prevent future invasions, highlighting America's role as a mediator and guarantor. Broader U.S. involvement includes economic pressures on Russia and aid packages, though Trump's administration has signaled a potential reduction in unlimited support to encourage negotiations.


  **Europe and the UK: Unwavering Backing Amid Concerns Over U.S. Shifts**


  European nations, including the UK, have been vocal in supporting Zelensky's call for lasting peace, viewing the war as a direct threat to continental security. Leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Finland, and the EU have joined Zelensky in Washington, underscoring that no deal can be made without Ukraine's input and that borders cannot be redrawn by force. This "backup" reflects fears that Trump might "bully" Zelensky into concessions, as seen in past public dressings-down.


  The UK, under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has affirmed "unwavering" support, pledging military aid worth billions since 2022, including tanks, missiles, and training programs. In August 2025, Starmer welcomed U.S. openness to security guarantees and co-led a "coalition of the willing" with France to protect post-war Ukraine. Public opinion in Britain remains pro-Ukraine, with 80% favoring a Ukrainian victory. Europe's collective aid—encompassing weapons, humanitarian support, and refugee hosting—has been crucial, but leaders like German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron have cautioned against deals that reward Russian aggression. The EU's sanctions on Russia and NATO's enhanced presence in Eastern Europe further bolster Zelensky's position.


  **Russia's Perspective: Obstruction and Territorial Demands**


  Russia, under Putin, has consistently complicated peace efforts by rejecting ceasefires and insisting on territorial gains. Zelensky has accused Moscow of prolonging the war through refusal to halt killings, with Russia claiming full control of Luhansk and much of Donetsk as non-negotiable. Putin's "peace offer" to Trump demands Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk in exchange for freezing lines elsewhere, a proposal Zelensky deems unacceptable as it could enable future attacks.


  Russia's tactics include massive drone and missile barrages, with over 140 drones launched overnight on August 17, 2025, killing 10 in Ukraine. This escalation, amid talks, signals unwillingness to concede, viewing negotiations as a means to consolidate gains rather than achieve mutual peace.


  **The Role of Drones: Asymmetric Warfare and Escalation**


  Drones have transformed the battlefield, with Ukraine ramping up attacks on Russian targets in 2025 to disrupt supply lines and inflict economic damage. From January to May, Ukrainian drones caused over $10 billion in losses to Russia, targeting oil depots, refineries, and military sites. A notable strike in early August ignited a massive fire at a Sochi oil depot, blamed on Ukrainian drones. Operations like "Cobweb" in June demonstrated advanced capabilities, hitting deep inside Russia.


  Conversely, Russia has intensified its drone assaults, launching a record high in July—over 14 times more than the previous year—and bombarding Ukrainian cities like Vinnytsia. Ukraine's air defenses downed 88 of 140 drones in a single night in August, highlighting the drone war's intensity. This mutual escalation underscores Zelensky's call for a ceasefire, as drones prolong attrition without decisive gains.


  **Broader Implications: Aid, Economy, Refugees, and Global Security**


  Beyond diplomacy and drones, the war's ripples extend globally. Western aid—totaling hundreds of billions from the U.S., Europe, and UK—has sustained Ukraine's resistance, including weapons, training, and economic support. However, fatigue is setting in, with calls for peace tied to reducing aid burdens.


  Economically, Ukraine faces devastation, while Russia's sanctions-hit economy strains under drone-induced losses. Refugees number in millions, straining Europe. Globally, the conflict heightens NATO-Russia tensions, food insecurity, and energy prices, making Zelensky's push for lasting peace critical to stability.


  NATO aspirations remain a flashpoint; Zelensky seeks membership for security, but Russia views it as a red line, echoing pre-war agreements. War crimes investigations, supported by the UK and others, add layers, with Zelensky demanding justice for abducted children and atrocities.


  **A Path to True Peace?**


  Zelensky's reluctance to rush into an agreement stems from a desire for peace that endures, not one that invites future conflict. As talks unfold in Washington on August 18, 2025, with input from the USA, Europe, the UK, and amid Russia's intransigence, the world watches. Drones and military aid highlight the war's brutality, but diplomacy offers hope. Ultimately, lasting peace requires mutual concessions, strong guarantees, and international commitment—elements Zelensky champions to safeguard Ukraine's future
