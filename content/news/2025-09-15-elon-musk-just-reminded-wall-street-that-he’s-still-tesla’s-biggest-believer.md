title: Elon Musk just reminded Wall Street that he’s still Tesla’s biggest believer
excerpt: Musk bought about $1 billion of Tesla stock last Friday
summary: By Monday morning, Tesla shares were up 8.2 percent in pre-market
  trading, climbing to $428.  The $1 billion buy suggests he’s betting hard on a
  rebound — not just in Tesla’s share price but in its core business of selling
  electric vehicles at scale.

  Late Friday, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed
  that Musk scooped up roughly $1 billion worth of Tesla stock — his first
  open-market purchase in more than five and a half years. For a man who has
  famously tied his entire fortune and reputation to the electric car maker, the
  move is as much a signal as it is an investment.




  Elon Musk, never one to shy away from making the market move with a single stroke of his pen—or in this case, a click of his trading account—just spent roughly $1 billion buying Tesla stock on the open market. This is the first time in more than five years that Musk has bought Tesla shares directly, and Wall Street is already buzzing. According to a new SEC filing, the purchase went through last Friday, sending $TSLA surging more than 8% in pre-market trading to about $428.




  For context, Musk usually acquires Tesla stock through compensation packages, stock options, or carefully structured deals. Direct purchases on the open market are rare—and investors know it. That’s why the news immediately lit a fire under Tesla bulls. If the man running the company is putting his own money back in after half a decade, it signals more than confidence—it’s a public statement that he thinks the market has undervalued Tesla.




  The timing is especially interesting. Tesla has been under pressure for months, caught between concerns about slowing EV demand, intensifying global competition, and Musk’s own distractions with ventures like X and SpaceX. Analysts had begun to whisper about whether Tesla’s growth story was running out of road. Musk just responded in the most effective way possible: by betting a billion dollars of his own money that the story isn’t over.




  Market watchers now see this as both a symbolic and practical move. Symbolic, because it telegraphs conviction. Practical, because large insider buys often precede rallies, giving investors more confidence to pile in. Tesla shares, already volatile, are likely to see even sharper moves in the days ahead.




  Musk himself hasn’t commented publicly on the purchase yet, but the ripple effects are obvious. Traders are talking about this as a “reset moment” for Tesla—an insider’s reminder that, even with bumps in the road, the company still has one of the strongest long-term growth cases in the EV sector.




  Whether this $1 billion wager turns out to be a brilliant show of foresight or simply an expensive confidence play, one thing is certain: Elon Musk knows how to grab headlines—and move markets—with a single trade.
