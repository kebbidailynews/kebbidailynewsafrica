  By all standards, what happened in the House of Representatives today could
  become one of the most consequential decisions for Nigeria’s economic
  sovereignty. Hon. Unyime Idem — representing Ukanafun/Oruk Anam Federal
  Constituency — stood before his colleagues and did something that every
  patriot should be proud of. He presented a motion calling on the Federal
  Government to stop dragging its feet and finally collaborate with the Akwa
  Ibom State Government to establish the long-awaited Ibom Deep Seaport.




  For years, this project has been talked about like a myth — promised, postponed, and ignored. But today, Idem’s motion, co-sponsored by all nine members of the Akwa Ibom caucus, may finally breathe life into one of Nigeria’s biggest missed opportunities. The House didn’t just talk; it acted. It directed the Federal Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy, the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), and other relevant agencies to partner with Akwa Ibom to bring this seaport to life.




  This is more than a local development story — it’s about the future of Nigeria’s economic independence, global competitiveness, and job creation.




  **Why the Ibom Deep Seaport Matters**




  Let’s be clear: in today’s world, whoever controls trade, controls destiny. The global economy thrives on marine trade and what’s called the “blue economy” — the sustainable use of ocean resources to drive growth, create jobs, and improve lives. Nigeria, with its massive coastline and ocean access, should be leading Africa in this area. But instead, it’s been asleep at the wheel.




  That’s the heart of Idem’s argument. Akwa Ibom State — blessed with direct access to the Atlantic Ocean — has all it takes to become a logistics powerhouse. The state produces export-ready commodities like cocoa, palm oil, cassava, maize, timber, fish, and rubber. It’s also rich in oil, gas, and solid minerals like limestone and kaolin. Yet all these opportunities are being squandered because we lack a functional deep seaport.




  Imagine the absurdity: Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, depends heavily on overcrowded, outdated ports like Lagos’ Apapa, while massive economic potential sits untapped in the South-South.




  The Nigerian Ports Authority once projected that the Ibom Deep Seaport could attract over $5.6 billion in investment. That’s not pocket change — that’s a serious economic engine. It could position Akwa Ibom as a global maritime hub, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and open up thousands of new jobs for Nigerians.




  And yet, bureaucratic delays, lack of coordination, and political inertia have kept this goldmine on hold.




  **The Big Picture: Nigeria’s Blue Economy and the Future**




  The blue economy currently contributes about 2% to Nigeria’s GDP. That’s embarrassingly low for a nation with over 850 kilometers of coastline and rich maritime potential. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made it clear: the goal is to raise that figure to between 5% and 10%. But let’s be honest — that won’t happen by wishful thinking or political rhetoric.




  It takes bold, decisive leadership — the kind Hon. Unyime Idem demonstrated today. The establishment of the Ibom Deep Seaport could become the single biggest driver of that national goal. It would expand Nigeria’s haulage networks, improve export logistics, boost revenue, and create real economic diversification beyond oil.




  When fully operational, the Ibom Deep Seaport would do more than move goods — it would move lives. It would stimulate local economies, catalyze industrial growth, and strengthen the maritime value chain. Factories would rise around it. New roads and rail links would follow. Youth employment would skyrocket.




  And for once, Nigeria would stop being just an exporter of raw materials — it would become a true player in the global trade game.




  **Accountability and Action: No More Excuses**




  Here’s the truth: for too long, Nigeria’s development story has been one of unfulfilled promises and endless “committees.” But this motion represents something different — a clear call to accountability and action.




  The House didn’t just adopt the motion; it backed it up with oversight. It mandated the Committees on National Planning and Economic Development, Ports and Harbours, Finance, and Shipping Services to visit the project site, assess progress, and make concrete recommendations. This is the kind of transparency we’ve been asking for.




  Let’s be blunt: Nigerians are tired of seeing good projects die on paper. The Ibom Deep Seaport cannot become another victim of political delay or federal neglect.




  This isn’t about Akwa Ibom alone — it’s about Nigeria’s place in the world economy. While countries like Singapore, South Korea, and the UAE are building world-class seaports that define their prosperity, Nigeria is still debating feasibility reports.




  It’s time to flip the script.




  **The National Interest Comes First**




  What Unyime Idem and his colleagues did today transcends party lines. It’s about national interest. Nigeria needs leaders who think generationally — not transactionally. And that’s exactly what this motion represents.




  The Ibom Deep Seaport isn’t just another infrastructure project; it’s a strategic asset that could redefine trade across West and Central Africa. It could make Nigeria the region’s logistics capital — attracting ships, investments, and global partnerships.




  Let’s face it: dependence on Lagos ports has reached breaking point. Congestion, inefficiency, and corruption have crippled trade. The Ibom Deep Seaport offers a clean slate — a chance to build a smart, modern port from the ground up, using technology, transparency, and private sector investment.




  If implemented properly, it could become the benchmark for port operations in Africa.




  **Conclusion: The Time for Talk is Over**




  Nigeria’s economy is crying out for diversification. Oil revenues are shrinking, inflation is rising, and unemployment remains high. The solution isn’t just austerity — it’s innovation, production, and trade.




  The Ibom Deep Seaport is a gateway to that future. It’s not just about containers and ships — it’s about unlocking potential, empowering people, and reclaiming Nigeria’s economic destiny.




  Hon. Unyime Idem’s motion is a wake-up call to the Federal Government: enough delays, enough politics. It’s time to work with Akwa Ibom State and make this project happen. Because when the Ibom Deep Seaport finally opens its gates, it won’t just lift a state — it will lift a nation.




  Nigeria’s prosperity depends on leaders who act boldly and believe in the country’s potential. Today, one of them stood up — and history will remember that.
