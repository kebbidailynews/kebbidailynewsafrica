  Politics in Kebbi State took another theatrical turn this week as a coalition
  of civil society organizations marched into Government House to pay what can
  only be described as a loyalty visit to Governor Nasir Idris. On paper, it was
  a show of unity. In reality, it raises uncomfortable questions about the role
  of civil society in a democracy and whether independence is being traded for
  proximity to power.




  Led by their chairman, Ibrahim Ngaski, the CSOs pledged to “partner” with the Idris administration against what they characterized as unfair attacks by opposition voices. “Kebbi is our state, and we do not want to see it castigated outside,” Ngaski declared, sounding less like a watchdog of government excess and more like a political surrogate.




  It’s a striking development. Civil society groups are supposed to be the independent referees of democracy — the institutions that keep governors accountable, that check inflated claims with hard data, that protect ordinary citizens when politicians overreach. When they line up behind an incumbent, parroting the language of power, the line between accountability and advocacy begins to blur.




  Governor Idris, for his part, welcomed the embrace. He rattled off a list of achievements — a $350 million lithium plant in Libata promising 45,000 jobs, and a $600 million cement factory in Maiyama expected to deliver 55,000 jobs. Big numbers, big projects, all still on the drawing board. Investors, we’re told, are lining up. The governor insists that negative reporting is the only obstacle between Kebbi and its economic renaissance.




  But here’s the problem: skepticism isn’t sabotage. In healthy democracies, questioning job figures or scrutinizing investor commitments is part of public duty, not treachery. A lithium plant sounds transformative, but Nigerians have heard such promises before — hundreds of thousands of jobs dangled before elections, only to vanish into thin air. Cement factories, steel complexes, and “world-class” refineries litter the country’s political history. To dismiss every question as opposition sabotage is to dodge accountability altogether.




  On security, the governor grew sharper. He condemned “frivolous allegations” that his government had imported mercenaries and called the petitions “pure falsehood.” Again, it’s worth asking: if the allegations are so baseless, why not open the records and prove them false? Dismissing critics as “irresponsible” without providing transparency only deepens public suspicion.




  Even more telling was Idris’s response to social media criticism. He accused opponents of sponsoring individuals online to disparage him and Kebbi. “As the Divinely Ordained Governor of Kebbi State, I remain unperturbed,” he said. That phrase — “divinely ordained” — speaks volumes. It is the language of inevitability, of rulers who see themselves as anointed rather than elected, accountable more to fate than to voters. Civil society’s role should be to puncture that rhetoric, not applaud it.




  The larger issue here isn’t whether Governor Idris has attracted investors or repaired roads. It’s about whether Kebbi is drifting into a culture where dissent is automatically equated with sabotage, and where organizations built to protect civic space instead become cheerleaders for the ruling administration. The opposition may exaggerate, yes. But unchecked power is far more dangerous than noisy criticism.




  This is where the CSOs should tread carefully. Aligning too closely with government risks eroding their credibility. When civil society becomes an extension of state power, the people lose their only real buffer against excess. The message of Monday’s visit — that the CSOs will stand by the governor against his critics — is comforting for Idris, but troubling for democracy in Kebbi.




  Nigeria’s democratic experiment is fragile enough without watchdogs turning into lapdogs. The governor says he is focused on building roads, factories, and jobs. Good. But citizens need more than promises; they need proof. And they need independent voices willing to hold his administration to account. Civil society, if it is to retain its soul, must resist the temptation to become another arm of political power.




  Kebbi doesn’t need fewer critics. It needs more transparency. It needs civil society organizations that ask hard questions, not stage-managed solidarity visits. If Governor Idris truly believes his projects will transform Kebbi, scrutiny should be welcomed, not silenced. That is what separates strong democracies from weak ones.
