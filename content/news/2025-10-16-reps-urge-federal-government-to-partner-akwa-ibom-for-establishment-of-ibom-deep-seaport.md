  The House of Representatives has called on the Federal Government to collaborate with the Akwa Ibom State Government for the establishment and realization of the long-awaited Ibom Deep Seaport, a project expected to transform Nigeria’s maritime and export economy.




  The resolution followed a motion of urgent public importance moved earlier today by Hon. Unyime Idem, representing Ukanafun/Oruk Anam Federal Constituency, and co-sponsored by the other nine members of the Akwa Ibom caucus.




  In adopting the motion, the House directed the Federal Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy, the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), and other relevant agencies to work in partnership with the Akwa Ibom State Government to actualize the project.




  Hon. Idem, in his presentation, emphasized that the global economy is increasingly driven by marine trade and the blue economy — which involves the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and job creation. He lamented that Akwa Ibom’s vast ocean resources remain largely untapped, resulting in lost investment opportunities and reduced economic potential.




  He disclosed that the Nigerian Ports Authority had projected that the Ibom Deep Seaport could attract investments worth over $5.6 billion, noting that the project’s prolonged delay has hindered the development of intermodal transport systems and limited Nigeria’s participation in the global blue economy.




  *“The Ibom Deep Seaport, when realized, will directly stimulate local economies, create thousands of jobs, catalyze industrial growth, strengthen maritime value chains, and support the implementation of Export Processing Zones (EPZ) blueprints,” Idem said.*




  He further highlighted Akwa Ibom’s strategic location on the Atlantic coastline and its abundance of exportable commodities such as cocoa, palm oil, cassava, rubber, fish, and seafood, alongside solid minerals like crude oil, gas, kaolin, and limestone. According to him, these natural advantages position the state as a viable hub for export-driven industrialization and blue economy expansion.




  The lawmaker noted that the blue economy currently contributes about 2% to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and that President Bola Tinubu’s administration has set a strategic goal to increase this contribution to between 5% and 10%. He expressed optimism that the realization of the Ibom Deep Seaport would be instrumental in achieving this national target.




  *“I am hopeful that the establishment of the Ibom Deep Seaport will expand haulage networks, boost export capacity, attract foreign direct investments, and significantly grow Nigeria’s GDP,” he added.*




  Following deliberations, the House mandated its Committees on National Planning and Economic Development, Ports and Harbours, Finance, and Shipping Services to undertake an oversight visit to the proposed project site in Akwa Ibom State. The committees are expected to assess progress and provide recommendations to facilitate the project’s speedy implementation.




  The Ibom Deep Seaport, once completed, is projected to become one of West Africa’s largest and most advanced maritime facilities — a gateway for trade, industry, and economic diversification for both Akwa Ibom State and the nation at large.
