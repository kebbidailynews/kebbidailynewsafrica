  It’s the kind of story you’d expect to see scripted on television, not playing
  out in real life. Chris Diamantopoulos — the actor best known for his
  hilarious turn as Russ Hanneman, the coke-snorting, bro-y billionaire
  caricature in HBO’s Silicon Valley — has revealed in a rare interview that
  he’s become the real thing: an actual billionaire. Not through acting. Not
  through Hollywood deals. But by buying massive stakes in AI companies at the
  right time.




  The story almost sounds like parody. Diamantopoulos admits that in 2021, during the feverish height of the web3 craze, crypto startups were literally paying him on Cameo to read off their fundraising announcements. We’re not talking small checks either. These were multimillion-dollar Series A rounds — “$65 million Series As,” he says — with startups desperate to make noise. He pocketed that money, shrugged, and did what very few actors ever do with Hollywood side hustles: he dumped it all into AI. Specifically, he put it into OpenAI special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) and grabbed what he calls a “giant slug of Anthropic.”




  Now he’s sitting on wealth that would make his fictional alter ego blush.




  There’s something deeply revealing about this. We live in an age where tech fortunes are no longer built on building, but on timing — and where celebrity, hype, and access can get you into financial rocket ships long before the public even knows they exist. Diamantopoulos didn’t found OpenAI. He didn’t build Anthropic’s safety frameworks. He admits openly that he just “buys whatever AI company my broker tells me.” And yet, through this passive alignment with the right speculative wave, he’s vaulted into the billionaire class.




  It says as much about the AI bubble as it does about him. In Silicon Valley’s real economy, investors are pouring money into anything with “AI” in the name. Valuations have skyrocketed, IPO chatter is nonstop, and the insiders — those with access to SPVs, secondary markets, and quiet rounds — are becoming unimaginably wealthy, often overnight. Diamantopoulos, by sheer accident of celebrity and timing, rode that train.




  There’s also an irony so rich it almost feels scripted by Mike Judge himself. On HBO, Russ Hanneman was the exaggerated stereotype of the shallow tech billionaire who cashed in during the dot-com era, more interested in flash than substance. Diamantopoulos played him perfectly, turning him into a meme-worthy symbol of tech’s absurd excess. And now, off-screen, he has stumbled into the same archetype — except it’s not satire. It’s real. The actor has become the thing he once lampooned.




  Unbelievable? Sure. But maybe not surprising.




  This is how our economy works now. The gains aren’t going to the engineers grinding at their keyboards, or the researchers sweating over breakthrough models. They’re going to celebrities who can get into the right deals, billionaires who can buy stakes before IPOs, and private brokers who connect the rich to the next big thing. Diamantopoulos is refreshingly honest about it. He’s not pretending to be some visionary investor. He flat-out says he just follows his broker’s advice and the money flows in.




  In some ways, that candor makes this story even more striking. It exposes how little of this boom is about insight or innovation, and how much of it is about access. Ordinary people can’t buy Anthropic stock. They can’t sneak into OpenAI’s SPVs. They’re locked out. But a Hollywood actor who did some Cameos? He’s now a billionaire.




  The parallels to the dot-com bubble are impossible to ignore. Back then, it was celebrities endorsing Pets.com and day traders flipping stocks. Today, it’s AI hype, SPVs, and valuations that defy logic. What makes this moment different is the sheer scale of the stakes. AI isn’t a sock puppet. It’s already transforming industries, rewriting the future of work, and threatening to upend global politics. The wealth around it, therefore, isn’t just another speculative bubble. It’s a reshaping of who holds power in the digital age.




  Diamantopoulos is an odd, almost comic symbol of that shift. He didn’t engineer ChatGPT, but he owns part of it. He didn’t architect Anthropic’s Claude, but he profits from it. That’s how capital works: whoever can get in early, stays rich. Whoever can’t, stays locked out. The fact that our new AI billionaires now include sitcom actors tells you all you need to know about how warped this system has become.




  And yet, there’s something poetic about Russ Hanneman becoming real. The man who played tech’s biggest joke is now living proof that the line between parody and reality in Silicon Valley has completely collapsed. Maybe Diamantopoulos is laughing the hardest, and maybe we should be laughing too — except the joke, as always, is on everyone else shut out of the bubble.




  The question now is how long this can last. AI hype is still accelerating, but so are questions about sustainability, regulation, and whether valuations can possibly match reality. Diamantopoulos may have bought in at the perfect time, but bubbles always burst. If history is any guide, when it does, it won’t be the Russ Hannemans of the world left holding the bag. It will be ordinary people who bought late, long after the brokers and celebrities cashed out.




  Unbelievable? Yes. But in 2025, in a world where AI companies dominate the markets and wealth is minted through access instead of contribution, maybe it’s exactly what we should expect.
