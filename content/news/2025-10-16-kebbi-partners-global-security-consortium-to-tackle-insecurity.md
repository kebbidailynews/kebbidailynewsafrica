  Kebbi Partners Global Security Consortium to Tackle Insecurity


  By Kebbi Daily News Correspondent – Birnin Kebbi




  The Kebbi State Government has taken a major step toward enhancing public safety as Governor Nasir Idris, Kauran Gwandu, hosted a delegation from G-Safety, a global security consortium, to explore partnerships aimed at strengthening the state’s security network.




  The meeting, which took place on Wednesday at the Government House, Birnin Kebbi, focused on boosting intelligence gathering, leveraging technology, and supporting the efforts of existing security agencies to combat crime and criminality in the state.




  Governor Idris described the engagement as timely and strategic, noting that Kebbi is determined to strengthen its security architecture through innovative and collaborative measures.




  “We invited them to advise and work with us so that our security agencies can understand, respond effectively, and live up to expectations in addressing challenges in some local government areas,” the governor said.




  “We want to hear what they have to offer, agree on workable terms, and if convinced, see how we can collaborate to achieve lasting peace.”




  Speaking after the meeting, Ahmed Saleh Junior, Security Consultant for G-Safety, said the consortium — headquartered in Beijing, China, with more than 36 branches globally — provides integrated security solutions for governments and institutions around the world.




  He explained that Kebbi, like several states in Northwestern Nigeria, has been affected by the criminal activities of the Lakurawa group, stressing that G-Safety’s collaboration would complement the Federal Government’s ongoing military and intelligence efforts.




  “The Federal Government has deployed significant military, paramilitary, and intelligence assets to tackle the menace of the Lakurawa group,” he said. “Our role is to support these efforts with advanced intelligence and technological tools that will help ensure that people can sleep with their two eyes closed.”




  Saleh added that the partnership would enable Kebbi State to benefit from modern intelligence systems capable of generating real-time, actionable information to guide security operations.




  “We are offering the Kebbi State Government a state-of-the-art digital intelligence collection and collation system that will enhance coordination with existing federal security structures,” he explained.




  “Our goal is to help counter and stamp out the tide of insecurity in the state.”




  Governor Idris reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to making Kebbi one of the safest states in the country, pledging continued investment in technology-driven security initiatives and collaboration with credible international partners.




  The visit by G-Safety signals Kebbi State’s growing openness to innovative security partnerships that combine global expertise with local action — a move that could mark a turning point in the state’s ongoing fight against insecurity.
