  On July 20, 2025, political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen ignited a firestorm
  on X by calling out Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the “Make America Healthy Again”
  (MAHA) Secretary of Health and Human Services, for promoting soda at a fast
  food restaurant. Cohen, a former personal trainer, argued that soda—whether
  made with cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup—offers no nutritional value
  and fuels obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. His posts, amassing over 1.1
  million views, sparked a polarized debate, with some defending RFK Jr.’s focus
  on eliminating artificial ingredients and others accusing him of hypocrisy.
  This blog post dives into the controversy, RFK Jr.’s contradictory health
  stance, and what it means for public health in 2025.




  **The Controversy: RFK Jr.’s Soda Endorsement**


  Brian Tyler Cohen, known for his No Lie with BTC podcast, shared his frustration on X:




  “I was a personal trainer for almost a decade… the number one thing I would tell my weight loss clients was to eliminate soda and fast food from their diets. Here, the ‘MAHA’ Secretary of HHS is cheering on soda... at a fast food restaurant. Snake oil salesman.”




  Cohen doubled down, emphasizing water as the “magic formula” for health and slamming soda for spiking blood sugar, rotting teeth, and causing chronic diseases. His critique targeted RFK Jr., whose MAHA initiative under President Donald Trump’s administration promised to combat “Big Food” and promote healthier living. Yet, RFK Jr.’s appearance at a fast food joint praising cane-sugar soda—a shift from his decades-long crusade against processed foods—drew accusations of inconsistency.


  X users like @CharlesPerreir7 were quick to call it “boot-licking” for Trump, while @Mollyploofkins hinted at financial motives, tweeting, “Follow the sugar cane money.” Others, like @LaneB7777, defended RFK Jr., arguing he’s focused on removing harmful additives, not banning soda outright.




  The Health Case Against Soda


  Cohen’s stance aligns with decades of research:




  Nutritional Void: Soda, even with cane sugar, offers no vitamins, minerals, or fiber. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar—exceeding the American Heart Association’s daily recommended limit (36 grams for men, 25 grams for women).


  Health Risks: Studies link regular soda consumption to obesity (a 2023 CDC report tied sugary drinks to 63% of U.S. adult weight gain), type 2 diabetes (a 2019 BMJ study found a 20% risk increase per daily serving), and heart disease.


  Cane Sugar vs. HFCS: RFK Jr.’s push for cane sugar over high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has some merit—HFCS is linked to liver damage in a 2021 Nature study—but @PhilReed77 noted that while “soda with no artificial ingredients is safer,” abstaining is still best.




  As @DeborahMarie shared, quitting soda led to significant weight loss for her, echoing Cohen’s advice: “Drink water. You’ll live longer and have a healthier body.”




  RFK Jr.’s MAHA Mission: Vision or Hypocrisy?


  RFK Jr., a longtime environmental and health advocate, has built a career warning against “toxins” in food, water, and vaccines. His MAHA role, appointed in 2025, promised to tackle America’s obesity epidemic (42% of adults, per CDC) and chronic disease crisis. Yet, his soda endorsement at a fast food chain—potentially a publicity stunt tied to Trump’s affinity for fast food—undermines his message.


  X user @TheYellowJacket mocked Cohen’s absolutism but acknowledged the broader point: “Yes, it would be better if no one ever drank soda, but some of us are trying to make realistic changes.” Meanwhile, @CharlesPerreir7 speculated political motives, suggesting RFK Jr.’s stance aligns with Trump’s populist branding rather than health science.


  This isn’t RFK Jr.’s first contradiction. In 2023, he criticized processed foods but was spotted at McDonald’s, sparking similar backlash. His defenders, like @LaneB7777, argue he’s targeting harmful additives, not demonizing all fast food. Yet, promoting soda—cane sugar or not—clashes with MAHA’s goal of reducing chronic disease.




  The X Debate: Polarized Perspectives


  The X conversation revealed deep divides:




  Critics: @CharlesPerreir7 and @Mollyploofkins saw RFK Jr.’s move as politically driven or financially motivated, with the latter hinting at Big Sugar’s influence.


  Defenders: @PhilReed77 and @LaneB7777 argued for nuance, noting cane sugar’s relative safety and RFK Jr.’s focus on additives. @DavidDavidson pushed for “real sugar cane in glass bottles,” dismissing Cohen’s blanket condemnation.


  Skeptics: @SidMacleod quipped about soda’s ability to “take rust off a bumper,” reflecting distrust in processed drinks.




  Cohen himself engaged, challenging @THEE_ALFA_HOUSE’s claim that his view was “political” by asking, “Do you think ‘soda isn’t healthy, drink water’ is a political view?” The exchange underscores how health advice gets politicized in a polarized era.




  Implications for Public Health


  RFK Jr.’s soda endorsement sends mixed signals at a critical time:




  Confused Messaging: As HHS Secretary, RFK Jr. shapes national health policy. Promoting soda undermines efforts to curb the $150 billion annual cost of obesity-related illnesses (CDC, 2024).


  Erosion of Trust: Public health leaders must model consistency. RFK Jr.’s flip-flops risk alienating health-conscious Americans, as @CharlesPerreir7’s “snake oil” jab suggests.


  Industry Influence: @Mollyploofkins’ “sugar cane money” comment raises questions about corporate sway, especially as the soda industry (valued at $400 billion globally in 2025) pushes “natural” sweeteners to counter HFCS backlash.




  For individuals, Cohen’s advice—cut soda, drink water—remains a simple, evidence-based path to better health.




  How to Navigate Health Advice in 2025


  In an era of conflicting messages, take control of your health:




  Prioritize Water: As Cohen emphasized, water is free, accessible, and essential. Aim for 8-10 cups daily, per Mayo Clinic guidelines.


  Read Labels: If you consume soda, check for HFCS or artificial sweeteners. Cane sugar may be marginally better, but moderation is key.


  Question Leaders: Scrutinize public health figures like RFK Jr. Cross-check their advice against sources like the CDC or The Lancet.


  Use X Wisely: Platforms like X amplify debates but also misinformation. Follow credible voices like @DrEricDing or @Healthline for evidence-based health tips.


  Make Incremental Changes: As @PhilReed77 noted, cutting artificial ingredients is a step forward, even if soda isn’t ideal. Start small—swap one soda for water daily.






  Brian Tyler Cohen’s takedown of RFK Jr.’s soda endorsement exposes a deeper issue: when health leaders prioritize politics or optics over science, the public suffers. Soda, whether made with cane sugar or HFCS, is a nutritional dead-end linked to America’s chronic disease crisis. RFK Jr.’s MAHA vision could inspire change, but cheering soda at a fast food joint undermines his credibility.
