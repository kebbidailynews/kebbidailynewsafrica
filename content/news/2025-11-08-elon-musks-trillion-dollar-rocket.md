  In Austin, Texas, on November 6, 2025, [Tesla's annual shareholder
  meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/tesla-shareholders-musk-pay.html)
  turned into a high-stakes launchpad. With a resounding 75% approval, investors
  greenlit CEO Elon Musk's audacious compensation package—potentially worth
  nearly $1 trillion in stock options. It's not just a payday; it's a bet on
  humanity's mechanized future, where self-driving cars swarm cities and
  humanoid robots till fields. Musk, bounding onto the stage like a man who'd
  just dodged a court injunction, quipped, "I super appreciate it." But as
  confetti settled and shares ticked up 3% after hours, the question lingered:
  Has Tesla just fueled the world's first trillionaire, or lit a fuse for
  corporate excess? For more on Musk's unwavering commitment to Tesla, check out
  [this recent piece on his $1 billion stock
  purchase](https://kebbidailynews.com/news/2025-09-15-elon-musk-just-reminded-wall-street-that-he’s-still-tesla’s-biggest-believer)
  from [Kebbi Daily News](https://kebbidailynews.com/).


  This isn't Musk's first rodeo with eyebrow-raising remuneration. Back in 2018, Tesla's board crafted a similar performance-based plan: 12 tranches of stock options vesting only if Musk hit escalating milestones in market cap, revenue, and EBITDA. He smashed them, ballooning Tesla's value from $50 billion to over $1 trillion at its peak. Yet, a Delaware judge voided it in 2024, citing conflicts of interest—Musk's brother sat on the board, and the package lacked arm's-length negotiation. Undeterred, shareholders ratified it anyway in a 2024 vote, but legal wrangling dragged on. Enter 2025: With Tesla's market cap hovering at $1.5 trillion amid EV slowdowns and AI hype, the board doubled down, proposing an even grander sequel. No salary for Musk—just skin in the game, or rather, a mountain of it. [Dive deeper into the vote's implications](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/business/musk-trillion-dollar-pay-package-vote).


  The new package dangles 423.7 million shares, potentially catapulting Musk's ownership from 13% to 29%. Valued at today's prices, it's already a cool $878 billion; by 2035, if Tesla's stock moons, it could eclipse $1 trillion. But here's the kicker: It's all contingent. To unlock the full haul, Musk must pilot Tesla through 12 Herculean gates, blending financial fireworks with sci-fi feats. First up? A $2 trillion market cap—mere $500 billion away, tantalizingly close. Then it escalates: $8.5 trillion total by the end, dwarfing [Apple's current $3.5 trillion throne](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tesla-shareholders-approve-878-billion-pay-plan-elon-musk-2025-11-06/). Operationally, Tesla needs to deliver 20 million vehicles annually (it's at 1.8 million now), deploy 1 million robotaxis zipping fares across urban grids, and churn out 1 million Optimus humanoid bots—envision factory floors staffed by tireless androids. Oh, and hit $400 billion in EBITDA, up from last year's $16.6 billion. Miss a tranche? No stock. It's pure meritocracy, Musk-style: Results or bust.

  The vote itself was a thriller. Preliminary tallies showed 75% in favor among voting shares, a landslide that buried opposition from heavyweights like State Street ($52 billion stake) and Norway's $2 trillion sovereign fund, which decried the dilution and "key person risk." Proxy advisors [Glass Lewis and ISS urged "against"](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-shareholders-approve-musk-1-trillion-dollar-pay-package/), slamming the design as excessive—Glass Lewis noted board discretion could fudge metrics, a "backup plan" for Musk's windfall. Yet retail investors, galvanized on X (formerly Twitter), flipped the script. Charles Schwab reversed its "against" stance after online uproar, with one post crowing, "Schwab Folds... amazing turnaround" as Musk's platform amplified the revolt. [Vanguard ($115 billion holder) and BlackRock ($95 billion)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/tesla-elon-musk-shareholder-meeting-1-trillion-dollar-pay-package-rcna242223) stayed "for," betting Musk's vision outweighs the optics. Sawyer Merritt, Tesla whisperer extraordinaire, tallied the big four: Only State Street dissented. Prediction markets like Kalshi nailed it, with traders forecasting approval days ahead. [BBC covers the global reaction](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyk6kvyxvzo).


  X lit up like a Cybertruck under aurora borealis. Supporters hailed it as capitalism purified. "The amount of people whining... hate a 100% results-based deal," tweeted Jeffery Mead, echoing a chorus of 71,000 likes. Robby Starbuck, conservative firebrand, prayed for divine guidance on Musk's bounty: "He’ll do tremendous good with that money." Bruno from MarketsAreMetal restored "faith in humanity," while Dan Bostic mocked media doomsayers: "The future is going to be AMAZING!" Edamommy03 framed it as "strong investor confidence in Musk’s vision," locking him in for AI dominance. Even skeptics conceded the logic: "They had no choice... Elon is the only one who can deliver," per StartupFrank. [The Guardian highlights the controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/06/tesla-1tn-pay-package-elon-musk).


  Critics, though, saw red flags waving from a yacht of inequality. Historian Timothy Snyder fired a viral shot: "Elon Musk’s new pay package would feed all forty million Americans on SNAP for the next ten years. He wouldn’t notice the difference but the country would." It racked 536,000 views, fueling debates on wealth chasms. [Pope Leo XIV (in a hypothetical 2025 twist) fretted CEOs earning 600 times the average worker](https://www.investopedia.com/elon-musk-got-his-usd1-trillion-pay-package-now-tesla-s-moonshot-goals-are-in-focus-11845843)—up from 4-6 times in the 1960s—warning of "big trouble" in prioritizing such sums. Oxfam's report stung: The top 10 U.S. billionaires, Musk included, pocketed $69.8 billion last year—833,631 times a typical household's income. Ladylawyer reveled in schadenfreude: "LIBERAL HEADS EXPLODING!!!" as if the vote were a partisan gut-punch. Reuters captured the divide: Investors endorsed Musk's pivot from "struggling EV maker" to "AI and robotics juggernaut," but not without the whiff of controversy.

  What does this mean for Tesla? Short-term, it's jet fuel. Shares, down 43% earlier this year amid Musk's DOGE distractions (his Trump-era efficiency czar gig), have clawed back 16% YTD. The package cements Musk's grip—no poaching by rivals like OpenAI—and aligns incentives for moonshots. Optimus bots could slash labor costs; robotaxis, a $10 trillion market by 2030 per ARK Invest. But risks lurk: Tesla's Q2 earnings flopped, with revenue and EPS missing marks, as Chinese rivals like BYD erode EV dominance. If autonomy falters—Full Self-Driving still beta after a decade—those tranches stay locked. Dilution hits common shareholders too, though backers like Ron Baron argue Musk is the "ultimate 'key man,'" without whom Tesla evaporates.

  For Musk, it's legacy rocket fuel. At $473 billion net worth, he's halfway to trillionaire status—eclipsing Rockefeller's inflation-adjusted $630 billion. Vested shares can't sell for 7.5 years, but he votes them immediately, fortifying control. Philanthropy whispers: Starlink for global internet, Mars colonization via SpaceX. Yet, as Not Jerome Powell tweeted, it's "mind blowing"—a symbol of how one man's gamble can redefine economies.

  Society? The trillion-dollar question. [Yahoo Finance laid it bare](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-what-elon-musk-needs-to-do-to-earn-his-tesla-trillion-164739829.html): Unlocking requires transforming industries, but at what cost? Wealth gaps yawn wider, even as Tesla electrifies transport and automates drudgery. Snyder's SNAP math stings, but proponents counter: Musk's prior package minted $56 billion while creating 140,000 jobs and $1.5 trillion in value. Tom Nash nailed the reaffirmation: "Investor confidence in Elon's leadership" trumps ESG naysayers. Passive Trader eyed the charts: "WE GET PAID."

  As dawn broke on November 8, 2025, Tesla's Gigafactory hummed on. Musk's trillion isn't pocketed yet—it's a constellation of ifs, a decade-long odyssey. But with shareholders strapped in, the rocket lifts. Will it pierce the trillionaire stratosphere, or sputter in regulatory crosswinds? One thing's certain: In Elon's world, the stars aren't just for reaching—they're for owning. And if he pulls it off, we'll all be along for the ride, for better or bot.
