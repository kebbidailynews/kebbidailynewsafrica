  EDISON, NJ — What began as a routine Sunday afternoon at the Target on Route 1
  turned into a full-on viral moment after three Indian women, now dubbed “The
  Target Aunties” online, were detained for alleged shoplifting — and the
  footage has social media gasping, roasting, and reenacting their now-iconic
  excuses.


  The incident occurred on Sunday, July 14, around 2:15 PM, but footage only began surfacing late Tuesday, instantly exploding across X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Instagram Reels. The clip, posted by user @SuburbanSpill, has since garnered over 7.2 million views, turning a simple loss prevention stop into a global cultural commentary.


  **The Scene Unfolds**


  In the now-viral video, Sushmita Patel (53), Kavita Mehra (49), and Priya G. Menon (55) — all residents of nearby Iselin, a heavily South Asian suburb — are seen being confronted by Target’s security staff after allegedly concealing unpaid merchandise in large tote bags.


  Eyewitnesses say the women appeared calm—too calm.


  “It didn’t even look like panic. They were just chatting, acting like they were reorganizing their purses,” said Monique Alvarez, a customer who witnessed the situation unfold. “Then security comes in and boom—it turns into a soap opera.”


  According to the Edison Police Department, the items recovered included candles, skincare products, and snacks totaling approximately $278.54 in unpaid goods. All three women were issued summonses for misdemeanor retail theft and released at the scene.


  **The Excuses: Instant Internet Lore**


  But it wasn’t the theft that caught everyone’s attention — it was the audacity of the excuses.


  “This is how we shop in India! It’s cultural,” one woman allegedly told the officer, according to a police incident report and video captions circulating online.


  Another reportedly claimed, “I was holding it for my cousin — she went to get the cart!” prompting stunned silence from store staff.


  X user @AuntyEnergy posted a screengrab of the moment with the caption: “She said it’s cultural like she’s swiping a mango from the street market, not a $20 candle in Jersey.”


  Since then, TikTok creators have flooded the platform with reenactments, remixing the moment with Bollywood soundtracks, adding dramatic zoom-ins, and creating duets titled “How My Mom Would Defend This.”


  The hashtag #TargetAuntie has been trending worldwide, with more than 500,000 mentions in 48 hours.


  **Community Divided: Embarrassment or Empathy?**


  While many online are finding the humor in the moment, others—particularly within the Indian and South Asian communities—are expressing discomfort.


  “It’s embarrassing. It feeds every stereotype we’ve been trying to push past,” said Rajiv Banerjee, a community organizer based in Jersey City. “But it’s also a wake-up call about how out-of-touch some elders are with how seriously things like this are taken in the U.S.”


  Still, others are calling for understanding, pointing out that cultural and generational gaps may play a role in these incidents.


  “In some parts of India, bargaining or even casually holding onto things in shops is common,” one viral thread noted. “That doesn’t excuse it, but it shows there’s a deeper disconnect at play.”


  **What’s Next?**


  According to Edison PD, all three women are scheduled to appear in Middlesex County Municipal Court on August 5, 2025. Target has declined to press felony charges, and no physical altercations occurred.


  In a brief statement, a Target spokesperson said:


  “Our stores prioritize the safety of our guests and team members. We follow consistent procedures for theft incidents and appreciate the cooperation of local authorities.”


  **TL;DR**


  Three Desi aunties got caught shoplifting at a Target in Edison. Their excuses were so wild, the internet turned it into a full-on meme moment. Charges are real. The cultural debate? Even more real.
