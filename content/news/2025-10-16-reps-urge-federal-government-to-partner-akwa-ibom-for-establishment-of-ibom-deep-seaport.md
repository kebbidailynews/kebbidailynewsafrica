  The Federal University Birnin Kebbi (FUBK) has issued formal summons to
  students accused of engaging in examination misconduct during the Second
  Semester of the 2024/2025 Academic Session. The announcement, made through an
  official statement signed by the Chairman of the University Examination
  Misconduct Committee, Prof. Abdulaziz Shehu, directs all affected students to
  appear before their respective Faculty Examination Misconduct Committees for
  trial.




  According to the circular dated October 11, 2025, the sessions are scheduled to hold on Wednesday, October 15, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. in the Board Rooms of the respective faculties. The document, issued from the Office of the Vice Chancellor, emphasized that attendance is compulsory for all students whose names have been linked to examination malpractice cases recorded during the recently concluded semester examinations.




  The university management stated that the measure forms part of ongoing efforts to safeguard academic integrity and maintain the sanctity of its examination process. Students are expected to appear in person and present any relevant documents, evidence, or testimonies in their defense before the committees.




  “The University Examination Misconduct Committee hereby invites all students alleged to have been involved in Examination Misconduct during the Second Semester Examinations of the 2024/2025 Academic Session to appear before their respective Faculty Committees as scheduled,” the statement read in part.




  It further warned that any student who fails to appear before the committee would be deemed to have forfeited their right to a fair hearing. “Please note that failure to appear before the Committee as scheduled will be considered as a waiver of the right to fair hearing, and the Committee will proceed to determine the case in their absence based on the available evidence,” the notice added.




  **University Reaffirms Commitment to Academic Discipline**




  The university’s decision reflects a firm stance on upholding discipline and credibility in its academic processes. In recent years, Nigerian universities have intensified their campaigns against examination malpractice, a problem that continues to undermine the value of higher education and the integrity of graduates.




  Speaking on the development, a senior administrative officer (who preferred anonymity because he was not authorized to speak officially) told The Daily Chronicle that FUBK remains committed to transparency and fairness in handling disciplinary issues. “The committees are guided by university regulations and the principle of fair hearing. Every student will be given the opportunity to defend themselves. But at the same time, the university cannot compromise its standards,” he said.




  He added that the institution had, over the past few years, implemented stricter invigilation procedures and technological monitoring systems during examinations to curb malpractice. “The Vice Chancellor has made it clear that we must preserve the credibility of our degrees. This is not about punishment alone; it’s about deterrence and setting an example,” he noted.




  **Background: Rising Cases of Examination Misconduct**




  Examination malpractice remains one of the recurring challenges confronting tertiary institutions across Nigeria. From impersonation and unauthorized materials to digital cheating and result tampering, many universities have had to strengthen their disciplinary frameworks.




  According to education analysts, the increasing pressure on students to achieve academic success, coupled with inadequate preparation and social distractions, has contributed to the rise in such cases. However, they also point to systemic issues such as overcrowded classrooms, limited supervision, and insufficient student support as enabling factors.




  At FUBK, the University Examination Misconduct Committee (UEMC) was established to address such cases promptly and ensure due process. The committee operates in line with the institution’s academic regulations, which prescribe penalties ranging from warnings and suspension to outright expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense.




  Prof. Abdulaziz Shehu, who signed the statement, is believed to have led several previous panels that dealt with examination-related offenses. His committee works in conjunction with faculty representatives to ensure that each case is investigated thoroughly.




  **Student Reactions and Campus Atmosphere**




  Following the announcement, the mood on campus has been one of mixed reactions. While some students welcomed the move as a step toward fairness and accountability, others expressed concern about the possible implications for their academic progress.




  A 300-level student of the Faculty of Management Sciences, who spoke under anonymity, said that while the notice had created anxiety among some students, it also served as a warning to others. “Nobody wants to be on that list. It’s embarrassing and could ruin your academic record. But at the same time, if you’re innocent, it’s your chance to clear your name,” she said.




  Another student argued that the university should provide counseling and academic support rather than resorting only to disciplinary measures. “Some students make mistakes out of ignorance or pressure. There should be a balance between discipline and rehabilitation,” he suggested.




  The Students’ Union Government (SUG) is reportedly monitoring the situation closely. A member of the SUG executive who spoke briefly said the union would ensure that all affected students receive fair hearings and that no one is victimized unjustly. “We trust the committee to be impartial, but we will also advocate for transparency throughout the process,” he said.




  **Expert Opinions and Broader Implications**




  Educational experts have lauded the move by FUBK as a proactive measure that aligns with global best practices in academic governance. Dr. M. A. Lawal, an education policy analyst based in Abuja, said the university’s approach reinforces the principle of accountability in the Nigerian university system.




  “Universities must uphold the integrity of their examination systems. The credibility of a degree is tied to the credibility of the process that produced it,” he explained. “By summoning students to defend themselves, FUBK is showing that it values justice and fairness while protecting its reputation.”




  He also advised that institutions combine discipline with preventive education, including ethics training and continuous sensitization of students about the consequences of misconduct. “Deterrence works best when students are aware of the rules, the risks, and the long-term impact of academic dishonesty,” he added.




  **Looking Ahead**




  The upcoming hearings, scheduled for October 15, are expected to attract close scrutiny from both students and staff. Sources within the academic community suggest that the number of alleged cases may be higher than in previous years, a reflection of increased vigilance during examinations.




  Meanwhile, the University Examination Misconduct Committee has assured that all proceedings will be conducted professionally and confidentially. Outcomes of the hearings will be forwarded to the University Senate for ratification and final decision.




  As FUBK continues to strengthen its disciplinary framework, the institution’s leadership has reiterated that its ultimate goal is not punishment but reform — to build a culture of honesty, diligence, and responsibility among its students.




  “Examination integrity is the foundation of academic excellence,” a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Education told The Daily Chronicle. “Without it, certificates lose their value, and society loses trust in our graduates.”




  The university community now awaits the outcome of the hearings, which are expected to set a precedent for future cases and reaffirm the institution’s zero-tolerance policy toward academic dishonesty.
