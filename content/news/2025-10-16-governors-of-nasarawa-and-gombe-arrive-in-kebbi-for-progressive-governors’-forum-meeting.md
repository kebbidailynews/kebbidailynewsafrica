  Birnin Kebbi, October 16, 2025 — The Executive Governors of Nasarawa State,
  Engineer Abdullahi Sule, and Gombe State, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, arrived in
  Kebbi on Thursday afternoon ahead of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF)
  meeting scheduled to hold in the state capital, Birnin Kebbi.




  Their arrival marks the beginning of a significant political gathering bringing together governors elected under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to discuss national development issues, inter-state collaboration, and strategies for strengthening good governance within the federation.




  The governors touched down at the Sir Ahmadu Bello International Airport, Birnin Kebbi, where they were warmly received by a delegation of top Kebbi State Government officials led by the Deputy Speaker of the Kebbi State House of Assembly, Hon. Muhammad Samaila.




  Also present at the airport were senior members of the Kebbi State Executive Council, political aides, and representatives of local government councils who came to extend a warm northern welcome to the visiting governors.




  **Warm Reception and Symbolic Unity**




  The arrival of the two governors was met with excitement and optimism among the people of Kebbi, as the meeting represents another opportunity for the Progressive Governors’ Forum to strengthen unity, promote collaboration, and renew its commitment to the principles of the All Progressives Congress (APC) — the ruling party at the federal level.




  The Progressive Governors’ Forum, often regarded as the engine room of inter-state policy innovation, brings together governors of APC-controlled states to deliberate on national issues, align developmental policies, and share experiences on governance.




  In a brief interaction with journalists upon arrival, aides to the visiting governors noted that the meeting in Kebbi was not just a routine gathering but a strategic forum aimed at reinforcing the collective resolve of APC governors to deliver tangible development and uphold accountability in their respective states.




  Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe, known for his focus on infrastructural development and fiscal reforms, is expected to play a leading role in discussions relating to economic diversification and fiscal sustainability, while Governor Abdullahi Sule, a strong advocate for industrial growth and private sector participation, will likely emphasize investment partnerships and digital governance as key talking points.




  **Kebbi’s Growing Political Significance**




  The choice of Kebbi State as host of this edition of the PGF meeting carries both symbolic and strategic significance. Under the leadership of Governor Nasir Idris, Comrade Dr. (Kauran Gwandu), Kebbi has been steadily positioning itself as a beacon of stability and reform in the Northwest geopolitical zone.




  Governor Idris, who has consistently demonstrated a commitment to inclusive governance, economic revival, and enhanced security collaboration, has in recent months drawn national attention through major policy initiatives and his openness to strategic partnerships with local and international organizations.




  Just days before the PGF meeting, the governor had received a delegation from G-Safety, a global security consortium, to discuss ways to strengthen Kebbi’s security architecture and complement the efforts of existing agencies. This underscores the administration’s commitment to both regional stability and cross-border cooperation.




  Hosting the Progressive Governors’ Forum in Kebbi therefore highlights the state’s emergence as a hub for political dialogue and strategic coordination among Nigeria’s northern APC states.




  **Agenda of the Progressive Governors’ Forum Meeting**




  Although details of the closed-door agenda were not immediately disclosed, sources within the Progressive Governors’ Forum confirmed that the Kebbi meeting will focus on several critical national and sub-national issues.




  Top on the list are discussions surrounding federal-state collaboration on security, agriculture, and economic recovery in the wake of the ongoing fiscal reforms being implemented by the Federal Government under President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.




  **Other areas of interest include:**




  Improving food production and agricultural value chains — especially given the strategic agricultural potential of northern Nigeria.




  Strengthening state-level revenue generation to reduce dependence on federal allocations.




  Expanding social welfare and youth empowerment initiatives to cushion the effects of subsidy removal and inflation.




  Fostering political stability and cohesion within the party at both national and grassroots levels.




  A senior government official in Kebbi noted that “the meeting is also expected to provide a platform for governors to share progress reports on state-level projects and to align their developmental blueprints with the Renewed Hope Agenda of the Tinubu administration.”




  **Strengthening Federal-State Cooperation**




  The Progressive Governors’ Forum has, over the years, served as a stabilizing force within the APC, helping to mediate between federal and state governments and ensuring a unified approach to governance challenges.




  With current national debates surrounding fiscal autonomy, local government reforms, and national security coordination, this meeting in Kebbi comes at a particularly important time.




  Governor Sule of Nasarawa, who has been vocal about the need for improved synergy between states and the federal government, is expected to reiterate the call for technological innovation in governance, stronger fiscal accountability, and private-sector-driven growth.




  Similarly, Governor Yahaya of Gombe, who chairs several inter-state economic development committees, is expected to emphasize the importance of infrastructure financing, rural development, and effective utilization of natural resources to sustain growth and reduce poverty.




  **Atmosphere of Camaraderie**




  At the airport, there was a clear display of camaraderie as the visiting governors exchanged pleasantries with officials and local dignitaries. Traditional drummers and cultural troupes entertained guests, while the airport surroundings were adorned with banners welcoming the dignitaries to the “Land of Equity.”




  Deputy Speaker Hon. Muhammad Samaila, who led the Kebbi reception team, described the visit as “a proud moment for the state,” noting that “Kebbi is honored to host leaders who have shown consistent commitment to national unity and progressive governance.”




  He added that “this forum provides not just a political meeting but a chance for collective introspection, learning, and inspiration across the APC states.”




  **National Implications**




  Observers believe that the outcomes of the PGF meeting in Kebbi could influence key national discussions ahead of the upcoming National Economic Council (NEC) deliberations and intergovernmental budget planning sessions.




  By uniting the policy priorities of APC-controlled states, the forum could play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of national economic recovery efforts, especially in light of Nigeria’s transition towards a more diversified and technology-driven economy.




  Political analysts also note that the gathering may help consolidate the APC’s internal cohesion amid growing political realignments and rising public expectations.




  **A Look Ahead**




  As the governors settle in Birnin Kebbi for the main session of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, expectations remain high that concrete resolutions will emerge from their deliberations — resolutions that will translate into tangible improvements in governance, development, and inter-state cooperation.




  The choice of Kebbi as host state, the participation of forward-thinking governors like Sule and Yahaya, and the active leadership of Governor Nasir Idris all signal that the APC is seeking renewed focus on performance, policy continuity, and people-centered governance.




  For the people of Kebbi, the meeting is more than a political event — it is a testament to the state’s growing national relevance, its hospitality, and its readiness to play a leading role in shaping Nigeria’s political and economic trajectory.




  As the forum commences, all eyes will be on Birnin Kebbi — the city that, this week, stands as the meeting point of ideas, leadership, and progress in Nigeria’s evolving democratic landscape.
