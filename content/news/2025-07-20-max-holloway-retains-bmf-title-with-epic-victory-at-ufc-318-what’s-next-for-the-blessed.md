  On July 20, 2025, Max "Blessed" Holloway solidified his legend status at UFC
  318 in New Orleans, retaining the BMF (Baddest Mother Fucker) title at
  lightweight with a thrilling unanimous decision victory over Dustin Poirier in
  their third encounter. Bouncing back from his last featherweight loss to Ilia
  Topuria, Holloway’s performance was a masterclass in heart and skill, earning
  him widespread praise as “The Best is Blessed Once Again 🙏.” This 500-word
  blog recaps the electrifying fight, its key moments, and predicts what’s next
  for Holloway in the UFC.


  The Holloway-Poirier trilogy fight headlined a stacked UFC 318 card, hailed as the “card of the year” by fans on X. From the opening bell, Holloway showcased his signature high-volume striking, landing 8.1 significant strikes per minute with pinpoint accuracy. Poirier, a fan-favorite known for his grit, countered with powerful hooks and a guillotine attempt in Round 2, but Holloway’s elite footwork and 70% takedown defense kept him in control. The fight’s defining moment came in Round 5 when Holloway, true to his BMF ethos, pointed to the ground, inviting Poirier to stand and trade. The ensuing flurry of strikes had the Smoothie King Center erupting, with SportsCenter tweeting, “THIS FIGHT 😱 #UFC318.” Holloway’s 30-27, 29-28, 29-28 scorecards sealed his victory, capping a legendary performance.


  Social media exploded with reactions, with Championship Rounds calling it “LEGENDARY!” for Holloway’s fearless stand-and-bang finish. The fight’s intensity, combined with Daniel Rodriguez’s upset over Kevin Holland and Vettori vs. Allen’s war, made UFC 318 a standout event. Tragically, Poirier announced his retirement post-fight, laying down his gloves after a storied career, adding emotional weight to Holloway’s win.


  Holloway, now 27-8 (23-8 UFC), proved his versatility by thriving at 155 pounds, where he holds a 4-1 record. His featherweight loss to Topuria in 2024 fueled doubts, but this win reaffirmed his elite status. At 33, Holloway’s durability (never knocked out in 35 fights) and fan-friendly style make him a cornerstone of the UFC’s lightweight and featherweight divisions.


  What’s Next for Holloway? Three potential matchups loom:




  Justin Gaethje (No. 3 Lightweight): A BMF title defense against Gaethje promises fireworks. Both fighters’ aggressive styles could produce a Fight of the Year. Prediction: Holloway outboxes Gaethje for a unanimous decision, leveraging his volume and cardio. Likelihood: High, given the BMF title’s allure.




  Ilia Topuria (Featherweight Champion): A rematch for the 145-pound belt would test Holloway’s redemption arc. Prediction: Topuria’s power poses a threat, but Holloway’s experience could lead to a decision upset. Likelihood: Moderate, if Holloway returns to featherweight.




  Charles Oliveira (No. 2 Lightweight): A title-eliminator against Oliveira would pit Holloway’s striking against elite grappling. Prediction: Holloway stuffs takedowns, winning via TKO in Round 3. Likelihood: Low, pending lightweight title picture.






  Holloway’s BMF reign and fanbase ensure big fights ahead. His next move could target the lightweight title or a featherweight redemption.
